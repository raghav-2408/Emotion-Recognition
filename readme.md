# Emotion Recognition by Textual Tweets Classification Using Voting Classifier (LR-SGD) 

# Abstract 

People share their feelings openly on social media, making it important to understand emotions from text. This project focuses on recognizing emotions in tweets using a method that combines two modelsâ€”Logistic Regression (LR) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). By using both, we improve accuracy and make predictions more reliable. Our system studies tweets to identify emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, and fear, which can help in areas like mental health support and tracking public opinion. Tests show that our LR-SGD method works better than using a single model, making it a useful way to understand emotions from text. This research helps improve how computers analyze human emotions in written content.

With the rise of social media, people express their emotions more openly through text, making emotion recognition an important tool for understanding user sentiment. This project focuses on classifying emotions in tweets using a voting classifier that combines Logistic Regression (LR) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). By blending the strengths of both models, we aim to improve accuracy and make predictions more reliable. Our system analyzes tweets to detect emotions like joy, sadness, anger, and fear, helping in areas like mental health monitoring and social media sentiment analysis. Experimental results show that our LR-SGD approach performs better than individual models, making it a promising method for emotion classification. This research contributes to the growing field of natural language processing (NLP), offering a practical solution for understanding emotions in textual data.
