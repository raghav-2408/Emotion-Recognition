# Emotion Recognition by Textual Tweets Classification Using Voting Classifier (LR-SGD) 

# Abstract 

People share their feelings openly on social media, making it important to understand emotions from text. This project focuses on recognizing emotions in tweets using a method that combines two models—Logistic Regression (LR) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). By using both, we improve accuracy and make predictions more reliable. Our system studies tweets to identify emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, and fear, which can help in areas like mental health support and tracking public opinion. Tests show that our LR-SGD method works better than using a single model, making it a useful way to understand emotions from text. This research helps improve how computers analyze human emotions in written content.

With the rise of social media, people express their emotions more openly through text, making emotion recognition an important tool for understanding user sentiment. This project focuses on classifying emotions in tweets using a voting classifier that combines Logistic Regression (LR) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). By blending the strengths of both models, we aim to improve accuracy and make predictions more reliable. Our system analyzes tweets to detect emotions like joy, sadness, anger, and fear, helping in areas like mental health monitoring and social media sentiment analysis. Experimental results show that our LR-SGD approach performs better than individual models, making it a promising method for emotion classification. This research contributes to the growing field of natural language processing (NLP), offering a practical solution for understanding emotions in textual data.

# Introduction

Social media platforms, especially Twitter, have become a hub for people to share their thoughts, opinions, and emotions. With millions of tweets generated daily, understanding the emotions behind these texts is becoming more important, especially for businesses, mental health monitoring, and social analysis. However, manually analyzing such a massive amount of data is challenging, making automated emotion recognition essential.

This study focuses on classifying emotions in tweets using a voting classifier that combines Logistic Regression (LR) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). By leveraging these models with TF-IDF features, we aim to improve accuracy in detecting emotions like joy, sadness, anger, and fear. Our approach is tested on multiple datasets, including both binary and multi-class emotion classification, proving its effectiveness in handling real-world data.

By comparing our method with popular machine learning models such as SVM, Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, and Random Forest, we highlight the advantages of our voting classifier in sentiment analysis. The results demonstrate that our approach not only improves classification performance but also provides a stable and efficient way to analyze emotions in text. This research contributes to the growing field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) by offering a practical solution for emotion recognition, with potential applications in social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and mental health assessment.
